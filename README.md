### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to meet the AEP (Alternative Educational Placement) Personalized Transition Plan requirements for NISD and TEC 37.023. This project involves a Google Sheet that is used as a database. A script emails teachers when the student is 7 days out from returning to their campus. The teachers click on a hyperlink that is provided in the email and fill out their feedback in the Google Sheet. When the associate principal verifies that all of NAMS' staff has filled out the necessary information on the database and is ready to email the student's home campus, letters are created using the Autocrat Chrome Extension. Once the two letters are created. <br><br>
